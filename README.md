## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Probably the worst thing here was trying to do the card shadows manually, so I decided to use an on-line tool more intuitive.

### Continued development

I always relay on flexbox when working in responsive layouts, but I know I need to practice with Grids too. Looking forward to apply it in the future.

### Useful resources

- [Material Design Box Shadows](https://htmlcssfreebies.com/material-design-box-shadows/) - It's impossible to do complex and good-looking box shadows manually, so this tool is really helpful.
- [CSS Flexbox Layout Guide | CSS-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This was one of the firsts guides I studied when learning Flexbox and it's in my bookmarks since then.
